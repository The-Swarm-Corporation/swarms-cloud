## Getting Started

### 1. Initialize Your Project

After installing the Swarms Cloud package, you can start by initializing your project using the following command:

```bash
swarms init --project "MyFirstAgent"
```

This will create a new directory and scaffold the basic structure needed to create your first agent.

### 2. Creating an Agent

Build your agent using any framework of your choice. Swarms Cloud supports a variety of frameworks and languages, making it easy to integrate any existing agent into the marketplace.

For example, if you're using the Swarms framework, you can start building your agent like this:

```python
# Example of a basic agent implementation
class MyAgent:
    def process(self, input_data):
        # Your agent logic goes here
        return {"response": "Hello from MyAgent!"}
```

### 3. Set Metadata for Your Agent

To publish an agent, you need to define the metadata, such as the agent's description, pricing model, and category.

```bash
swarms set-metadata --name "MyFirstAgent" \
    --description "An agent for automating customer support" \
    --pricing "subscription" --rate "$50/month"
```

### 4. Publish Your Agent

Once your agent is ready, publish it to the marketplace with a single command:

```bash
swarms publish
```

This will deploy your agent to the **Swarms Cloud Marketplace**, where it will be globally accessible for businesses to discover and integrate. -->

## Managing Your Agents

Once your agent is published, you can monitor its performance and usage via the **Swarms Cloud Dashboard**. Here are some of the key management features:

- **API Usage Analytics**: Track the number of API calls, users, and income generated.
- **Pricing Adjustments**: Update the pricing or subscription model for your agent at any time.
- **Version Control**: Manage different versions of your agent and roll out updates seamlessly.
- **Licensing Options**: Choose between subscription-based models, pay-per-use, or full-access licensing.

---

## Monetizing Agents

The Swarms Cloud Marketplace enables you to monetize your agents in a variety of ways:

- **Subscription-Based Pricing**: Set recurring fees for users to access your agent.
- **Pay-per-Use**: Charge users based on their actual API usage.
- **Custom Licensing**: Offer exclusive access to your agent for specific customers or use cases.
  
For example, if you want to charge based on API usage:

```bash
swarms set-metadata --name "DataAnalyzerAgent" \
    --pricing "pay-per-use" --rate "$0.10/call"
```

Once published, businesses can subscribe to or purchase your API directly from the Swarms Marketplace.
